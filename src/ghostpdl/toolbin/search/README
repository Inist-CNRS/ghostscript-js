Scripts for searching gs revision
Typically the goal is to find a revision that either changed the checksum of an image, or changed an image in a "significant" way.


run.py for one revision, one device tuple, one testfile
	supports pdfwrite
	"standard directories":
		/home/regression/comparefiles
		pnm/ for output files
		pdf/ for pdfwrite output files
		logs/ for log files
	normal: 
		calculate checksum and delete the output file, 
		capture output in logs/<long file name>, E.g. logs/000-00.ps.7800.ppmraw.300.0.pnm.stderr



runlist.py
	for {range of revisions on one testfile, a list of testfiles on one revision, a range of revisions on a list of testfiles}
	only one device tuple

common use:
	nice runlist.py --low=7437 --high=7806 --listfile=<listfile> --dochecksum --cleanup
	<listfile> would be a list of testfiles, with support for # as comment character

TO DO:
	in run.py change to use stdin for all testfiles, since a few require it 119* -- DONE

	allow control of device tuples, including support for pdfwrite

	collect elapsed time (use exec* procedures) and output file size
