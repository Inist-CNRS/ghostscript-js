The directories gen_stochastic and gen_ordered contain tools to generate
threshold arrays for use with ghostscript.

In the thresh_map directory is a tool that converts the "tos" (turn on sequence)
file produced by the above threshold array tools into a PostScript file usable
by ghostscript or any Level 2 compliant PS interpreter. The "tos" may have more
than 256 levels, so thresh_remap creates a threshold array with 256 levels.

Also thresh_remap optionally applies a transfer function as it converts the
"tos" so that a device can produce 256 levels that are visibly linear.

Refer to the README file in each directory for more information.
