xps2tiff converts XPS files to multipage RGB TIFF files using Microsoft's own
means.

Usage: xps2tiff RESOLUTION_DPI INPUT.XPS OUTPUT.TIFF

The program uses .NET 3.0 Framework and requires Visual Studio 2005
to compile.

Some sample files allocate over 1GB of memory at 300 dpi resolution.
Virtual memory appears to work reasonably well.
