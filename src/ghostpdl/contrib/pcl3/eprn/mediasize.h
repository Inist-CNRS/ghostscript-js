  Sizes
  =====

  The constants of type 'ms_Size' each represent a rectangular area ("sheet")
  completely characterized by the lengths of its two edges. The orientation
  of the sheet is unspecified but note that the 'ms_SizeDescription' entries
  are guaranteed to return information such that dimen[0] <= dimen[1].

  The names of the size constants are mostly identical to the values for the
  "mediaOption" keywords in PPD files, prefixed with "ms_".  The keywords are
  documented in Appendix B, "Registered mediaOption Keywords", of:

      Adobe Systems Incorporated
      "PostScript Printer Description File Format Specification"
      Version 4.3
      9 February 1996
      Document ID: PN LPS5003

  It can be obtained from http://www.adobe.com.

  The following list does not contain all sizes from PPD 4.3, but all
  internationally standardized sizes are present.

  Media codes
  ===========

  PPD 4.3 describes several standard qualifiers ("." followed by a string) and
  substrings for mediaOption keywords. The type 'ms_MediaCode' is
  intended for representing a combination of 'ms_Size' with a set of flags
  holding additional information of this kind.

  The additional information, as standardized by Adobe and as far as it is
  supported here, consists of information concerning external conditions
  ("Extra" and "Transverse") and information relating to the way the medium is
  used ("Big"/"Small" and "Rotated"). I've also added two flags which the using
  application can endow with any meaning it needs.

  Use bitwise OR with the flag values to construct an 'ms_MediaCode' instance
  from an 'ms_Size' instance.
  Use ms_flags() and ms_without_flags() to split a value of type 'ms_MediaCode'
  into its components.

/*  Generate a media code for a name

    Acceptable names are all size names and all size names extended with any
    combination of the known substrings and qualifiers. The rules for forming a
    name recognized by this function are:
    - The order is: base name, substrings, qualifiers.
    - No string may appear twice.
    - At most one of "Big" and "Small" may be present.
    Note that "Transverse" is only permitted as a qualifier and "Rotated" may
    only appear as a substring. PPD 4.3 seems to prefer substrings to
    qualifiers where possible.

    The pointer 'user_flag_list', if non-NULL, must refer to a sequence of
    entries associating user flags with names. The list is terminated by the
    first entry having a zero 'code'. The names in this list will be recognized
    as substrings in addition to the standard names. The list will be searched
    linearly for a matching entry.

    The function returns 'ms_none' if it cannot convert the name.

    The function has the following restrictions:
    - The flags returned do not distinguish between appearance as a substring
      and appearance as a qualifier or consider the order of appearance.
    - There is no support for serialization qualifiers.
*/
extern ms_MediaCode ms_find_code_from_name(const char *name,
  const ms_Flag *user_flag_list);

/*===========================================================================*/

/*  Construct a name for a media code

    The pointer 'buffer' must be non-NULL and point to a storage area of at
    least 'length' octets. The function will convert 'code' into a string
    representation and write it to 'buffer', terminating it with NUL. The list
    'user_flag_list', if non-NULL, is taken into account for the conversion of
    user flags in 'code'. It is searched linearly until the first entry with a
    zero 'code'. If an appropriate entry is found it is added as a substring
    before all standard substrings.

    The function returns zero on success and a non-zero value otherwise.
    In the latter case, 'errno' will have been set to one of the following
    values:
    - EDOM: 'code' contains an unkown size or an unknown flag. The last case
      includes the situation where a user flag is found in 'code' and
      'user_flag_list' is NULL or does not contain a matching entry.
    - EINVAL: 'buffer' is NULL or 'length' is zero.
    - ERANGE: 'length' is insufficient to store the resulting string.
