/*  Page Size codes (permitted arguments for the PCL command "Page Size")

    There exists an area of confusion around this command in connection with
    "orientation" in various senses. Unfortunately, the documentation made
    externally available by Hewlett-Packard is not only incomplete but also
    inconsistent in this respect. (Well, not only in this respect, but don't
    get me started on this topic or I'll run out of screen space.) In
    particular, HP does not distinguish between "input orientation"
    (orientation of a sheet with respect to the feeding direction: short edge
    first or long edge first) and "page orientation" (orientation of a sheet
    with respect to the "up" direction of the page contents: portrait or
    landscape). This is further complicated by the fact that PCL permits
    several relative orientations between text and graphics data.

    The following information is therefore partially in disagreement with
    HP documentation but does agree with the actual behaviour of the DJ 850C.

    (1) The Page Orientation command has no influence on the orientation of
        raster graphics data.
    (2) Therefore it is possible to define, independent of the Page Orientation
        setting, a coordinate system on the medium by reference to the printing
        of raster lines ("rows"): the order of pixels within a row defines what
        is left and right, and the order in which successive rows are printed
        distinguishes between up and down. I call this the "raster space"
        coordinate system. (Its units are irrelevant, but we need the
        directions.)
    (3) Because of the way DeskJet printers are constructed (limited memory!),
        raster space is fixed with respect to the feeding direction: the "up"
        edge of a sheet in raster space is the one entering the printer first
        (the leading edge).
    (4) Hence the media orientation in raster space depends only on the
        input orientation: short edge first leads to portrait and long edge
        first to landscape orientation in raster space.
    (5) Among other effects, the Page Size command sets in particular the
        printable region for the media size requested.
    (6) For raster graphics data, clipping occurs at the edge of the printable
        region. This happens at the right edge in raster space.
    (7) It is not possible in PCL to specify the input orientation one has
        chosen. In particular, the sign of a Page Size code has no influence on
        the printable region as seen in raster space.
    (8) Some Page Size codes do modify the orientation for text printing on
        some printers, but this can be overridden with a subsequent Page
        Orientation command.
    (9) The Page Size command usually sets up the printable region under the
        assumption of portrait orientation in raster space (i.e., the input
        orientation is short edge first). Exceptions occur with envelope sizes
        (Env10 and EnvDL) on older DeskJet printers (500 and 500C, possibly
        also 400) where envelopes have to be fed long edge first.

    The key conclusion to be drawn from this is that the layer represented by
    the functions in this interface does not have any information on the media
    orientation in raster space nor can this information be formulated in PCL
    and passed through this layer. It is information shared between the printer
    and the client code calling this interface, and the caller must therefore
    obtain it from an external source.

    In introducing the concept of a "raster space" I have deliberately avoided
    the term "physical page" used in the PCL documentation. The latter is not
    made sufficiently precise, and for printing raster data as done here the
    first concept is the one required.

    Two Page Size codes are marked "PS3". These are from Adobe's "LanguageLevel
    3 Specification and Adobe PostScript 3 Version 3010 Product Supplement"
    (dated 1997-10-10), page 352, where eight PCL-5 page size codes are listed.
    Six of these agree with PCL-3 page size codes, and the remaining two are
    those inserted here and marked "PS3". I have not heard of any PCL-3 printer
    supporting these two sizes as discrete sizes.

    The identifiers are usually named after the corresponding 'mediaOption'
    keyword from Adobe's PPD 4.3 specification.

        The order of bit planes within a strip group is as follows:
        - Each strip group consists of a number of "colorant strips", one for
          each colorant. All strips in such a group cover the same region on
          the page. Except for 'pcl_RGB', colorant strips are ordered in the
          sequence (K)(CMY), independent of 'order_CMYK'. For an RGB palette,
          the order is (of course) RGB.
        - Each colorant strip contains a number of pixel lines for this
          colorant. If there is more than one line, the lines are ordered from
          top to bottom as seen from raster space. The number of lines is
          the ratio of that colorant's vertical resolution to the smallest
          vertical resolution.
        - Within each pixel line for a colorant, bit planes are ordered from
          least to most significant. The number of bit planes within a line is
          pcl3_levels_to_planes(levels) for this colorant.
          When bit planes are again combined into lines for a particular
          colorant, the resulting value per pixel denotes the intensity for
          that colorant. A value of zero denotes absence of that colorant.
        'previous' will be ignored (and may then be NULL) unless a differential
        compression method is requested (pcl_cm_is_differential()).

        When using an RGB palette you should always send bit planes extending
        over the whole 'width' because shorter bit planes are implicitly
        extended with null octets and a pixel value of zero denotes black in an
        RGB palette which is not usually desired.

  The routines assume a simple state machine:

  - You are either on a page or between pages.
  - If you are on a page, you are either in raster mode or not.

  You should call pcl3_init_file() before the first page and between pages
  whenever you change the file-global data (like the resolution). Otherwise,
  use the ..._begin() and ..._end() functions to navigate between the states.

  Look into the implementation file for detailed interface descriptions for
  these routines.

  The error conventions are the same for all file, page and raster functions:
  - A return code of zero indicates success.
  - A positive return code indicates an argument error. This should be
    avoidable by careful programming.
  - A negative return code indicates an environment error (e.g., disk overflow).
  If a function returns with a non-zero code, an error message will have been
  issued on standard error.
