This package is based very heavily on the work of Uli Wortmann
(uli@bonk.ethz.ch), and I do not claim to be the original author of very
much of this code.  Uli has done a tremendous amount of excellent work, and
this package is a modification to his driver by me to add the ability to print
to the DeskJet 880C, 882C, and 895C printers.  Under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (see LICENSING TERMS below), I am distributing this
package under the same license.

Please also see the file readme.hp8 for Uli's notes about the package.

It is my intent to submit this work as a patch to Uli Wortmann for inclusion
in the original HP850C driver package.

DISCLAIMER:

This is a work still under development, and as such I do not guarantee
it will work (see LICENSING TERMS above).  However, please send bug
reports to me (mgelhaus@proaxis.com), along with as much information
as you can.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

This package is designed to work with Aladdin Ghostscript 5.50 (available
from ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs550/).  It may work with earlier
versions of Ghostscript, but I have not tested it.  You can follow the
directions included to compile Ghostscript, but here are is a condensed
version that worked for me:

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Obtain the files 
       
       ghostscript-5.50.tar.gz            2826251 bytes 
       jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz                  613261 bytes 
       libpng-1.0.2.tar.gz                 225386 bytes 
       zlib-1.1.3.tar.gz                   168463 bytes
       ghostscript-fonts-std-5.50.tar.gz  1444863 bytes 
       
2.  Create a directory to perform the build in, for example,
    /usr/local/src/gs.  Unpack each of the files into this directory:
    
    $ cd /usr/local/src
    $ mkdir gs ; cd gs
    $ tar zxvf $HOME/ghostscript-5.50.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf $HOME/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf $HOME/libpng-1.0.2.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf $HOME/zlib-1.1.3.tar.gz
    
3.  Copy all the files from this driver package into the ghostscript
    directory.  For example,
    
    $ cp $HOME/hp850C-880p/* /usr/local/src/gs/gs5.50/
    
    This will overwrite the files contrib.mak and makefile.  This is OK.

4.  If desired, edit the makefile.  This should only be necessary if you
    want to build a ghostscript binary that uses your existing PNG and
    ZLIB libraries dynamically.  Normally ghostscript compiles these in
    statically.  Note that you still need to download the sources to those
    libraries (as listed in step 1) even if you want to link dynamically.
    
5.  There is a bug (I think) in the ghostscript source.  If during the make
    it fails to build due to a missing "arch.h" in the file std.h, you can
    fix it by changing line 28 of std.h from
    
        #include "arch.h"
        
    to
    
        #include "obj/arch.h"

6.  Type 'make'.

7.  Type 'make install' (as root).

7.  To specify the 880C/882C/895C driver, use -sDEVICE=cdj880:

    $ gs test.ps -sDEVICE=cdj880 -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -sOutputFile=- | lpr
    

Please, please, please report any bugs to me at mgelhaus@proaxis.com.  This
includes installation instruction bugs, because I was doing this from
memory!
