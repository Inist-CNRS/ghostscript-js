Quick installation instructions for the Lexmark Z12 or Z31 printer under Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those who don't want to read the Ghostscript and CUPS documentation
I will provide here some short instructions.

I suppose you don't have CUPS and ESP Ghostscript installed on your system. 
You need the followings:
- CUPS (the current version is 1.1.18)
- ESP Ghostscript (current CVS version: espgs-7.05.6-source.tar.bz2)
- PPD file from www.linuxprinting.org
- cupsomatic Perl script from www.linuxprinting.org

1) Compile CUPS 
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var \
  --sysconfdir=/etc &&
  make && make install

2) Extract the ESP Ghostscript source.
  Replace the gdevlx32.c from the gsX.YZ/src directory with the one
  provided with this tarball. 
  Now we are ready to compile Ghostscript.
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-fontpath=/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts &&
  make && make install 

3) Copy the PPD file (Lexmark-Z12-lxm3200-tweaked.ppd or
   Lexmark-Z31-lxm3200-tweaked.ppd) to 
  /usr/share/cups/model
  chmod a+r Lexmark-Z12-lxm3200-tweaked.ppd
  or
  chmod a+r Lexmark-Z31-lxm3200-tweaked.ppd

4) Copy the cupsomatic Perl script to /usr/lib/cups/filter
   chmod 755 cupsomatic

5) Now we are ready to start CUPS:
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups start or /etc/init.d/cups start

6) Open your favorite web browser and connect to http://localhost:631.
   From the graphical CUPS configuration tool add a new printer.
   Select the "Lexmark Z12, lxm3200-tweaked" or 
   "Lexmark Z31, lxm3200-tweaked" from the list.
   If everything went well now you can print a test page.
   Remember that I have tested only B&W printing. If you select color,
   I cannot guarantee anything. 

Enjoy the Lexmark Z12/Z31 printing under Linux !

Note that the lxm3200 driver was written by Daniel Gordini,
so all credits go to him.

If you have problems setting up the Z12 or Z31, first of all read the CUPS 
and ESP Ghostscript documentation. If you are sure that the problem is 
connected with the driver, please contact us.
