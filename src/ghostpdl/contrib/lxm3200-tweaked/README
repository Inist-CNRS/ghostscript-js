=========================================

 Version 0.4.1 - Dec 19, 2000


These are the quick instructions needed to recompile a version
of Ghostscript >=7.00 for Linux that supports this driver.
The instruction assume you will use the "unix-gcc.mak" makefile,
i.e. you are using gcc on a Unix system to compile Ghostscript.
This is of course true for Linux.

Instructions:

1) Obtain and unpack the Ghostscript source distribution.

2) Copy the driver source (gdevlx32.c) into the gsX.YZ/src
   directory (e.g. gs7.05/src).

3) Modify the "contrib.mak" file as stated in the "Drivers.htm" 
	 documentation file, adding the following lines at the end:


## --- Add everything down from here, this line excluded --- ## 


### ---------------- Lexmark 3200 device ----------------- ###

lxm3200_=$(GLOBJ)gdevlx32.$(OBJ)

$(DD)lxm3200.dev: $(lxm3200_) $(DD)page.dev
	$(SETPDEV) $(DD)lxm3200 $(lxm3200_)

$(GLOBJ)gdevlx32.$(OBJ): $(GLSRC)gdevlx32.c $(PDEVH) $(gsparam_h)
	$(GLCC) $(GLO_)gdevlx32.$(OBJ) $(C_) $(GLSRC)gdevlx32.c


## --- Add everything up to here, this line excluded --- ##

   The blanks must be made by one or more TABs, and not by spaces. 
   This is important: if you put spaces there, the compilation will stop 
   with a "missing separator" error.
    
4) Modify the "unix-gcc.mak" file including the driver name shown above in
   the list of the drivers to compile. To do it, first look for the line 
   which starts "DEVICE_DEVS6=". It should contain a list of driver names, 
   such as "$(DD)bj10e.dev", "$(DD)bjc600.dev" and so on. 
   It is very likely that the list is broken in more than one line. 
   Please note that each line, except the last, ends with a "\" (backslash) 
   character. This is the continuation character, and it means that the list 
   does not end with the "newline" character but continues on the next line. 
   If the backslash is there, it MUST ALWAYS be the last character of the line: 
   there must be no spaces, tabs or any other character between the backslash 
   and the newline.
   Add the device name "$(DD)lxm3200.dev" at the end of the last line.
   Be careful not to put it after a backslash.

5) Recompile ghostscript with the command "make -f src/unix-gcc.mak"
   from the top of the unpacked ghostscript source tree.

6) Install the freshly compiled version of ghostscript, using the command 
   "make -f src/unix-gcc.mak install"

7) Enjoy your Lexmark 3200!

Additional notes:

1) The easiest way to install this driver is by using the current 
   ESP Ghostscript which incorporates the latest version.
   Just do a usual configuration, e.g.
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-fontpath=/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts
   and then make; make install.

2) Now the driver supports the Lexmark Z12 and Z31 (for additional informations
   see the RELEASE_NOTES).

If you have problems compiling Ghostscript, you should be able to solve them 
by reading carefully the documentation, expecially the section "Adding a 
driver" in the "Drivers.htm" file. DO NOT ASK ME FOR HELP IN COMPILING 
GHOSTSCRIPT, unless the compilation error is generated in the driver's file 
itself (that is gdevlx32.c).
