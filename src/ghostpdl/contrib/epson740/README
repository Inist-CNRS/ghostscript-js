Really short instructions...
(I hope to do better one of these days)

Changes:
  7/11/99  DEP  An update!! Separated the RH5.2 stuff, and added
                the new RH6.0 stuff. Also, the beginnings of a
                description of how to write a Uniprint file. In
                desparation, I've also removed the color trans-
                lations from the 360*360 upp file. It seems to
                do a better job than I did.

These locations are for RedHat 5.2 with Ghostscript 5.10 added,
or RH 6.0, which comes with 5.10. I've had a report of someone
adding Ghostscript 5.5 and using this stuff successfully.

The *.upp files go into /usr/share/ghostscript/5.10
The other two files go into /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters
(I'd suggest saving the original files, first)

I've made several virtual printers, all connected to the same
physical printer. The RedHat printtool did this just fine.
