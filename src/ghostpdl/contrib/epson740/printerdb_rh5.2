# Some printer types are commented out because by default ghostscript

# Printtool should filter this list for only those available through

#
# Changes:
#
# Wed Mar 12 - Added DeskJet500Mono entry - it is a B&W only driver (djet500)
#



#
# Newer HP deskjets
#
# gdevcdj.c
#
# For newer HP deskjet printers, the old names
#      cdeskjet, cdjcolor, and  cdjmono
# have been replaced by the following printers.
#
# to get the same behavior now, use
#     gs -sDEVICE=cdj500 -dBitsPerPixel=24 ...        for cdjcolor, and
#     gs -sDEVICE=cdj500 -dBitsPerPixel=1  ...        for cdjmono
#
# so use the -dBitsPerPixel= to set color/mono options
# also can set BlackCorrect, Shingling, and Depletion for best output
# described in drivers.doc with gs-3.33
# Also have PrintQuality and RenderType for xpaintjet XL300/XL too...
#
# Resolution: 300x300 except declj250 is 180x180, canon bjc-600 is 360x360
#             laserjet 4 dithered is 600x600.
#
# Color Support: 1, 3, 8, 16, 24, and 32( last is dj550c only)
# see the devices.doc for descriptions of what these do!

# This is a cheesy hack of the printerdb to allow choosing

# Selecting a resolution in the printtool control panel
# will select the proper stc800*.upp file.
# ps-to-printer.fpi must be hacked also. An
# if-then clause must be added to ps-to-printer.fpi which senses
# the uniprint driver assigned to $GSDEVICE and selects the proper
# stc800*.upp based on the value assigned to $RESOLUTION
# in /var/spool/lpd/stc800-spool-directory/postscript.cfg.
