/* A template for packed dictionary search method */

/*
 * Define template for searching a packed dictionary.
 *
 * Free variables:
 *      ref_packed kpack - holds the packed key.
 *      uint hash - holds the hash of the name.
 *      dict *pdict - points to the dictionary.
 *      uint size - holds npairs(pdict).
 *
 * Template parameters are :
 *	found   - the found key action.
 *	deleted - the deleted key action.
 *	missing - the missed key action.
 *
 * Note that the template is *not* enclosed in {}, so that we can access
 * the values of kbot and kp after leaving the template.
