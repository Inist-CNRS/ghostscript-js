/* A simplified version of the PJL parser and states for demonstration
   purposes.  It implements a subset of pjl - specifically PDL
   settable PJL environmant variables.  Clients should initialize the
   pjl parser with pjl_process_init() and release it with
   pjl_process_destroy().  The principle means of receiving
   environment variables is by the function call pjl_get_envvar() see
   below.  The return value of this function call will return the
   appropriate environment value requested.  Note there is no
   mechanism for clients to receive pjl default or factory default
   setting.  We assume clients are PDL's and only have to
   reset their state values to the pjl environment.  See PJLTRM for
   more details */
