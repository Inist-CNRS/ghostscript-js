 * H-P printers can switch languages more or less ad lib.  Currently,
 * we have to be able to handle 4 languages: PJL, PCL5*, HP-GL/2,
 * and PCL XL.  This file provides a tiny bit of structure common to
 * all languages and parsers, for the use of front-end programs that
 * don't want to worry about such things.
 *
 * At any given moment, the interpreter's state consists of:
 *	- Job parameters set by some mix of PJL and the current language;
 *	- User defaults for the current language;
 *	- Parsing state for the current language;
 *	- Parameters, graphics state, and downloaded data for the current
 *	language.
 * Currently we don't try to impose much structure on this, only enough
 * to make it possible to write the language switching code.
