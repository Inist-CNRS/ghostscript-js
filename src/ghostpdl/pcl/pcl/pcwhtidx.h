/* pcwhtindx.c - interface to code for finding white index of a palette */

/*
 * To implement transparency in PCL colored patterns and rasters, it is
 * necessary to identify those pixels which should be considered white, as
 * those are the pixels which should be transparent.
 *
 * "White" in the sense of PCL means white in the device color space, just
 * prior to dithering. Hence, the effect of normalization, color lookup tables,
 * and conversion from the source to device color lookup table are taken into
 * account before determining if a given pixel is (potentially) transparent.
 *
 * Such a mechanism is, unfortunately, not easily implemented via the existing
 * graphic library, as raster transparency is implemented via PostScript
 * ImageType 4 images. For these images, the single color or range of colors
 * required that identify pixels as transparent are specified in the source
 * color space, before any conversion.
 *
 * In this implementation, normalization of colors for black and white
 * reference points occurs before the raw data is ever considered a color,
 * so at least that part of the problem is handled correctly. Beyond this
 * canonical white--(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) in all color spaces--is assumed to yield
 * white; if it does not (due to color lookup tables), the results will be
 * incorrect.
 *
 * Where appropriate, this implementation also uses the graphic library's
 * support for indexed color spaces. Creating potentially transparent rasters
 * with these color spaces requires us to identify which entries in the
 * color palette are white. When there is only one such entry, this is simple.
 * When several palette entries are involved, life is more difficult. It is
 * then necessary to remap all raster values which map to a white palette
 * entry to the same white entry.
 *
 * For straight rasters, this is can be done in-place, as the raster will
 * never be rendered with another color space. Patterns are not so easily
 * handled, as they may be rendered subsequently with other color spaces.
 * Hence, for those it is necessary to copy the data.
 */

/*
 * Determine the white entry in the color palette of an indexed color space,
 * and perform any remapping that is required.
 *
 * The must_copy operand indicates if the raster data can be overwritten in
 * place (false) or if a new array must be allocated.
 *
 * Returns 0 if successful, < 0 in the event of an error.

/*
 * An alternative interface to the remapping capability, this one more suited
 * to working with rasters.
 *
 * Because rasters are provided in a large number of pieces (typically one
 * sanline is an individual piece), and all pieces are rendered using the
 * the same color palette, it does not make sense to re-derive the mapping
 * table for each raster. Consequently, the code below can be used to get
 * the mapping table once, re-use it for each piece, and then free it.
 *
 * This code is specifically intended for rasters, and will only create a
 * remap table if:
 *
 *     source transparency is required
 *     the current palette uses an indexed pixel encoding (by plane or
 *         by pixel)
 *     there is more than one "white" in the current palette.
