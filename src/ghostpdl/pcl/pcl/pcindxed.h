 * color spaces, however, via the CR command in GL/2.

/*
 * PCL indexed color space. This consists of:
 *
 *   A copy of the configure image data header (short form) which was used
 *       to create this color space (only the header is necessary; all the
 *       other relevant information is captured in the normalization and
 *       graphic library color space structures)
 *
 *   A PCL base color space, which in turn consists of a graphic library
 *       base color space and its associated client data (including lookup
 *       tables for device-independent color spaces)
 *
 *   A graphic library indexed color space
 *
 *   An indication of how many entries in the palette are currently
 *       "accessible" (this is required to support the GL/2 "NP" command)
 *
 *   The palette used by the indexed color space. This is always the maximum
 *       size, as GL/2 can change the number of entries in a palette without
 *       changing the palette (via the NP command)
 *
 *       In a reasonable world this palette would be a fixed size array of
 *       bytes in the (PCL) indexed color space structure. Unfortunately,
 *       the GhostScript graphic library is not a reasonable world in this
 *       respect. The table used by an indexed color space must be a string,
 *       which means it must be allocated separately. The gs_string structure
 *       kept in this structure is a pointer to this separately allocated
 *       string.
 *
 *   The set of pen widths. This has nothing to do with colors, but since
 *       pens in GL/2 are associated with palette entries in PCL, this is
 *       the logical place to put this information; issues concerning which
 *       units to use are still TBD.
 *
 *       Since there is no PostScript-centric library which must make use of
 *       these widths, they can be kept in a sensible array.
 *
 *   A boolean to indicate if a palette is fixed (with respect to colors; all
 *       palettes have settable pen widths).
 *
 *   A identifier, which is used to indicate when objects dependent on this
 *       color space must be regenerated. The identifier is incremented each
 *       time the color space is modified (but not when pen widths are
 *       modified, as the width information is not cached).
 *
 *   A structure for normalizing raw input values to component values in
 *       the palette; this supports the black/white reference points for
 *       each color component
 *
 *   A Decode array, to be used with images. This incorporates the same
 *       information as provided by the conversion parameters described in
 *       the previous item, but in a different form
 *
 * Note that the graphic state color space is referenced twice in this
 * structure: once by the indexed color space and again by the PCL base color
 * space. This arrangement is necessary because the graphic state base color
 * space does not take ownership of its client data.
 *
 * Though the palette is stored as a separate object, it is not possible
 * to share graphic library indexed color spaces between two PCL indexed color
 * spaces. Given the current structure of graphic state color spaces, this
 * problem is not easily remedied, as both the palette and the pcl base color
 * space must be kept in a one-to-one relationship with the graphic library
 * indexed color space.
