/* rtrstst.h - structure for holding raster information in the PCL state */

/*
 * The current state of the raster machinery.
 *
 * There are several fields in the structure whose presence (or absence) may not
 * be totally intuitive.
 *
 * 1. The graphics margin (the "horizontal" distance of the origin of the image
 *    from the applicable edge of the logical page) is a state variable, even
 *    though this fact is almost never apparent in practice. The parameter is
 *    significant only if "graphics mode" (in the sense used in the PCL
 *    documentation) is entered implicitly; all of the explicit ways of entering
 *    graphics mode (<esc>*r#A, where  # is in the range 0-3) set the graphics
 *    margin. Furthermore, if the graphics mode is ended via <esc>*rC (but not
 *    <esc>*rB), the graphics margin is reset to 0.
 *
 *    For ease of implementation, the graphics margin is in centipoints, but in
 *    the orientation of raster space. The latter feature is significant: it is
 *    possible to implicitly enter graphics mode in an orientation different
 *    from that in which the graphics margin was set. In this case, the
 *    displacement remains the same, but in a different orientation.
 *
 * 2. Whether or not raster scaling is (potentially) used for a given image
 *    is a state variable in some HP PCL implementations, but not in others.
 *    Speicifically, the DeskJet 1600C/CM never uses raster scaling on implicit
 *    entry into graphics mode, while the Color LaserJet 5/5M retains the
 *    state of the last entry into graphics mode (in the current PCL state).
 *    The latter approach is used in this code.
 *
 *    Note that it is the scale/don't scale value of the last entry into
 *    graphics mode that is retained, not whether or not scaling actually
 *    took place for that raster. In particular, assume that graphics mode
 *    was entered with <esc>*r[23]A but the raster was not scaled due to some
 *    other condition (palette not writable, source raster dimensions not
 *    supplied). If the condition preventing raster scaling is altered, and
 *    subsequently graphics mode entered implicitly, raster scaling will
 *    occur.
 *
 * 3. The situation with the scale algorithm feature is not yet clear. The
 *    documentation states ("PCL 5 Color Technical Reference Manual", May
 *    1996 ed., p. 6-42) that "This command is valid only after a Start
 *    Raster command (<esc>*r#A) with scale mode ON." While this might indicate
 *    that the scale algorithm is not a state variable, we tend to think the
 *    statement merely reflects a poor choice of wording. We believe it
 *    would have been better stated as "this command is not effective except
 *    after ..." A reason for this belief is that all of the commands that
 *    are "valid" after a start raster mode are of the form <esc>*b#, while
 *    the scale algorithm command is of the form <esc>*t#, as are the source
 *    resolution and destination dimension commands (all of which are state
 *    variables).
 *
 * 4. Clipping or rasters in PCL is handled in a manner similar to that of
 *    text, which leads to some curious behavior. Normally, rasters are clipped
 *    to the printable page boundary. However, if the raster orgin is at
 *    the logical page "right" or "bottom" boundary relative to the print
 *    direction, the raster is clipped completely, even in cases in which the
 *    logical page boundary is inside the printable region.
 *
 *    Centi-point precision is used to determine whether or not the raster
 *    origin is at the logical page boundary. For logical orientation 0 and
 *    2, the the logical page is either 25 or 21 pixels (at 300 dpi) inside
 *    the printable region, depending on the page size. Hence, it is possible
 *    to relocate a raster by one centipoint, and have a 25 pixel extent of
 *    that raster either appear or disappear.
 *
 *    This clipping is inconsistently applied when presentation mode 3 is
 *    used and the print direction is not along with width of the "physical"
 *    page. In this case, the perpendicular of the raster scanline direction
 *    points in the opposite of the print direction, thus the raster could
 *    move off the "left" edge of the logical page. No clipping is performed
 *    in this case, most likely due to the implementation method chosen by HP.
 *
 *    The field clip_all is set to true if the raster output is to be suppressed
 *    because the raster origin is at the logical page boundary. The motion
 *    implied by rendered scanlines must still be accounted for, hence the
 *    need for this field.
 *
 *    Because of the dis-continuous nature of this effect, it is sensitive to
 *    to arithmetic precision. It is possible to set up situations in practice
 *    in which the last bit of precision of a floating-point calculation will
 *    determine whether a raster is clipped or not. Fortunately, these
 *    situations do not arise in practice.
