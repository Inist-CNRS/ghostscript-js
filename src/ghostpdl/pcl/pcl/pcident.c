 * Return the next unique identifier.

 * Identifiers start at 8 to try to expose errors that might be masked by an
 * identifier of 0. In the unlikely event that so many identifiers are created
 * that the number wraps back to 0, the next assigned identifier will be
 * 16 * 1024 * 1024. This avoids potential overlap with permanent objects that
 * are assigned identifiers at initialization time.
 *
 * Special handling is also provided to avoid the no_UniqueID value used by
 * the graphic library.
