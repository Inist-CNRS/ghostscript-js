/*
 * Enter raster graphics mode.
 *
 * The major function of this routine is to establish the raster to device
 * space transformations. This is rather involved:
 *
 * 1. The first feature to be established is the orientation of raster space
 *    relative to page space. Three state parameters are involved in
 *    determining this orientation: the logical page orientation, the current
 *    print direction, and the raster presentation mode. These are combined
 *    in the following manner:
 *
 *        tr = (print_direction / 90) + logical_page_orientation
 *
 *        raster_rotate = (presentation_mode == 0 ? tr : tr & 0x2)
 *
 * 2. The next step is to determine the location of the origin of the raster
 *    to page transformation. Intially this origin is set at the appropriate
 *    corner of the logical page, based on the orientation determined above.
 *    The origin is then shift based on the manner in which graphics mode is
 *    entered (the mode operand):
 *
 *        If entry is IMPLICIT (i.e.: via a transfer data command rather than
 *        an enter graphics mode command), translation by the existing left
 *        graphics margin is used, in the orientation of raster space.
 *
 *        If entry is via an enter graphics mode command which specifies moving
 *        the origin to the logical page boundary (NO_SCALE_LEFT_MARG (0) or
 *        SCALE_LEFT_MARG (2)), action depends on whether or not horizontal
 *        access of print direction space and of raster space are the same:
 *
 *            if there are the same, the origin is left unchanged
 *
 *            if they are not the same, the origin is shifted 1/6" (1200 centi-
 *            points) in the positive horizontal raster space axis.
 *
 *        The latter correction is not documented by HP, and there is no clear
 *        reason why it should apply, but it has been verified to be the case
 *        for all HP products testd.
 *
 *        If entry is via an enter graphics mode command with specifies use
 *        of the current point (NO_SCALE_CUR_PT(1) or SCALE_CUR_PT(3)), the
 *        current point is transformed to raster space and its "horizontal"
 *        component is used as the new graphics margin.
 *
 *    Irrespective of how the "horizontal" component of the raster image origin
 *    is specified, the vertical component is always derived from the current
 *    addressable point, by converting the point to raster space.
 *
 * 3. Next, the scale of the raster to page space transformation is established.
 *    This depends on whether or not PCL raster scaling is to be employed.
 *    For raster scaling to be used, all of the following must hold:
 *
 *        the scale_raster flag in the PCL raster state must be set
 *        the current palette must be writable
 *        the raster source height and width must have been explicitly set
 *
 *    The scale_raster flag in the PCL raster state is normally set by the
 *    enter raster graphics command. Hence, if graphics mode is entered
 *    explicitly, the first requirement follows the behavior of the HP Color
 *    LaserJet 5/5M. The DeskJet 1600C/CM behaves differently: it will never
 *    user raster scaling if graphics mode is entered implicitly.
 *
 *    The reason for the second requirement is undoubtedly related to some
 *    backwards compatibility requirement, but is otherwise obscure. The
 *    restriction is, however, both document and uniformly applied by all
 *    HP products that support raster scaling.
 *
 *    If raster scaling is not used, the scale of raster space is determined
 *    by the ratio of the graphics resolution (set by the graphics resolution
 *    command) and unit of page space (centi-points). This factor is applied
 *    in both scan directions.
 *
 *    If scaling is employed, the situation is somewhat more complicated. It
 *    is necessary, in this case, to know which of the raster destination
 *    dimensions have been explicitly set:
 *
 *        If both dimensions are specified, the ration of these dimensions
 *        to the source raster width and height determine the raster scale.
 *
 *        If only one destination dimension is specified, the ratio of this
 *        dimension to the corresponding source dimension determins the
 *        raster scale for both dimensions; With strange interactions with
 *        the 1200centipoint margin and rotated pages (Bug emulation).
 *
 *        If neither dimension is specified, the page printable region is
 *        transformed to raster space, the intersection of this with the
 *        positive quadrant is taken. The dimensions of the resulting region
 *        are compared with the dimensions of the source raster. The smaller
 *        of the two dest_dim / src_dim ratios is used as the ratio for
 *        the raster scale in both dimensions (i.e.: select the largest
 *        isotropic scaling that does not cause clipping).
 *
 * 4. Finally, the extent of raster space must be determined. This is done by
 *    converting the page printable region to raster space and intersecting
 *    the result with the positive quadrant. This region is used to determine
 *    the useable source raster width and height.

     * Set up the graphic stat for rasters. This turns out to be more difficult

     *     a solid color or an uncolored pattern

     *     itself
     *
     * Since the graphic state can only hold one CRD and one halftone method
     * at a time, this presents a bit of a problem.
     *
     * To get around the problem, an extra graphic state is necessary. Patterns
     * in the graphic library are given their own graphic state. Hence, by
     * replacing a solid color with an uncolored pattern that takes the
     * foreground value everywhere, the desired effect can be achieved. Code
     * in pcpatrn.c handles these matters.
     *
     * The second problem is a limitation in the graphic library's support of
     * CIE color spaces. These spaces require a joint cache, which is only
     * created when the color space is installed in the graphic state. However,
