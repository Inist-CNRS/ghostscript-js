 * plsymbol.h, as a "symbol map".  A symbol map describes the mapping
 * from one symbol set to one glyph vocabulary.  A symbol set may
 * comprise multiple maps (currently at most two, one each for MSL and
 * Unicode).  We want a separate dictionary of symbol sets because
 * there are various operations performed per symbol set (affecting
