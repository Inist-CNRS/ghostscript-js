This collection is a 0.9 version of a fuzzy image comparison GUI
and command line (batch) tool.

It has only been tested with PPM files, and still has some 'warts'
and some TBI features, but is stable enough (I hope) to be useful.

I've built this on Windows with VS 2005 -- it probably will build
on other versions, but I haven't tried it.

This directory is made to be put into the "samples" directory of
wxWidgets, so FIRST you have to get wxWidgets 2.7.0 or 2.6.3 and
build the 'base' and 'core' modules.

On Windows, the base and core modules are built by the 'project'.

On linux, I recommend getting the wxWidgets source and doing:
	./autoconf
	./configure --disable-shared
	make

This will build the .a libraries. Then cd to samples/cmpi
and try 'make'. If you didn't get 2.7.0 then it will probably
fail -- you need to add 'cmpi' to the list of SAMPLE_SUBDIRS in
configure.in and re-run autoconf, then configure to get the
right Makefile in cmpi derived from Makefile.in.

If the build doesn't work, then dig into it. Ralph and I are
busy on other stuff, but if you beg for help, you might get
lucky (Ralph for linux or Mac, me for Windows). ;-)

The usage is similar to gs/toolbin/cmpi.py except the command
line interface has -w# and -c# fuzzy switches (and it aborts if
you don't give it the two .ppm files as input).

Note that there is also a -b switch to run it in 'batch' mode
so that the difference count gets appended to a log file
(cmpi.log by default) which is handy for gathering stats or
doing regressions.

For the PS CET, I found -w3 -c20 to be reasonable settings.
