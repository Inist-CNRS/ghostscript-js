This file highlights changes unique to the GhostPDL languages:
PCL/PXL, XPS, SVG and the language switch configuration.  Ghostscript
changes are documented in its own NEWS file.  GhostPDL uses a lot of
Ghostscript's code, in particular the graphics library and many output
devices are shared, so many items in the Ghostscript NEWS file are
relevant to GhostPDL.  GhostPDL users should consult both files.

  pxl/PXL_Color_Laserjet_4700_Differences.xls document and illustrate
  differences between the Artifex PCL interpreter and the HP Color
  Laserjet 4700.

* Include the new tiffscaled device.  This entry overlaps with a
  similar news entry in ghostscript news but the device is important
  for PCL fax customers and was worthy of mention here as well.  See
  Ghostscript news for details.

* The languages (PCL, XPS and SVG) now support the ps2write device.
  This is intended to replace pswrite which will eventually be
  deprecated in a future release.  The output of ps2write is
